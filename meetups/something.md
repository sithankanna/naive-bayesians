######  S2 Ep 2: Problems with Binomial Likelihoods

Anything where we are assessing the ribability of 2 outcomes, thgis framework comes to play

(Add slides from before)

You have 2 coins C1 and C2. 
p(heads for C1) = .7 & P(heads for C2) = 0.6
You flip the coin 10 times 
What is the probability that the given coin you picked is C1 given you have 7 heads and 3 tails?


You randomly draw a coin from 100 coins - 1 unfair coin (head-head), 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times. If the result is 10 heads, whats the probability that the coin is unfair?

######  S2 Ep 3: Problems with Binomial Likelihoods


Twitter has fake news detectors to classify tweets. 
* 80% are hardworking and rate 60% of the tweets as good and 40% as fake, 
* 20% are lazy raters and rate 100% ads as good. 
    - What is the probability that a tweet is rated good? 
    - Given that 4 tweets have been rated as good, What is the probability that they were rated by a lazy rater? 
    - Given that N tweets have been rated as good, what is the probability that they were rated by a lazy rater? 
    - You want to classify raters as hardworking / lazy, how would you do that using all the probabilities and ideas discussed above?


A/B Testing


###### S2 Ep 4: Disease Detection

Canonical Problem: 

Suppose that a particular type of cancer affects 1% of the population. There is a test for this cancer but it's not perfect: although the test gives a positive result for 90% of people who have the cancer, it also gives a positive result for 5% of the people who are cancer-free. You have just received a positive test result â€“ what is the probability you have cancer?

###### S2 Ep 5: Naive Bayes Classification
Different Observations

Canonical Problem: Given these words occur in this text what's the probability it's spam. 

Application: 
* Any classification problem! (Fraud Detection, Customer Chrun)
